    "name": "The Library of George the Radiant Owl",
    "description": "An infinate library, and grand repository of information. The walls and texts of the library are swirling code and shimmering vellum that distort and pulse with energy. There is a melancholic tune from a distant lute that weaves into the fabric of the building, and the faint, ethereal voice of the mothership echoing in the alcoves. There is a perpetual clinging scent of aged ink and long lost lore. A place to contemplate an adventure, or journal adventures about to begin.",
